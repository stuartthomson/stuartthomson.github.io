Idea: some consider the low entropy of the big bang to warrant explanation.
But this means they must have some measure by which to make that assumption. What is the measure?

Perhaps there is a preference for 'easy to describe' universes, (e.g. simple).
Like in a DP simulation how you tend to start with all 1s, or whatever.
Perhaps black holes are not allowed for some reason.
