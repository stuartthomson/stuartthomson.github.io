Idea: the 'past hypothesis' (low entropy big bang) is often used as an explanation of why we can remember the past.
Imagine we were in a universe that (by chance) would accumulate into a low-entropy state in the future.
Would entities in such a universe of 'memories'/'predictions' about that future?
If so, how do they "know" that they are in such a universe? It wouldn't be a good guess to assume it.
