Idea: Archetypes are useful not because people are in any way actually archetypes themselves, but because they span the space we are interested in: human qualia.

Archetype examples:
* Attachment types
* Tarot cards
* Probably Jung
* Some fictional characters. Hamlet, Raskolnikov? Lot of Dostoevsky honestly.
